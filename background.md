## Background

### Computed tomography
Computed tomography is a very popular in-vivo technique for medical imaging of patients. The images from CT scans can be reformatted in multiple planes and can even generate 3-D images. An advantage of CT scans over X-rays is that they have better information regarding internal organs, bones, soft tissue and blood vessels. 

Computed Tomography is an imaging procedure in which beam of X-rays are focused on a patient and rotated around the body producing signals that are processed to create slices of images of the patient. The X-ray detectors in the CT scanners are special and are located opposite to x-ray source. These signals are then passed on and by using numerical techniques of back-projection and radon transforms the signals are converted back to images that represent the organ of interest.Many organs such as Lung, Heart, Kidneys, Brain and Neck and Abdominal region can be imaged using CT imaging. In this thesis the organ of interest is the Brain tissue. 

The most common use of CT scans in brains is to detect pathologies of Bleeding, Brain Injury, Cavernoma, Atrophy, Aneurysm, Tumor etc. in a patient's brain. The CT scans can also be used in detection of Skull fracture and the associated bleeding in the Sub Arachnoidal regions.
